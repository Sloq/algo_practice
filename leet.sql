-- | 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |

SELECT A.Name as Employee

-- Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

-- +----+---------+
-- | Id | Email   |
-- +----+---------+
-- | 1  | a@b.com |
-- | 2  | c@d.com |
-- | 3  | a@b.com |
-- +----+---------+
-- For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

-- | Email   |

SELECT Email 
FROM Person 
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Email) > 1

-- Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

-- Table: Customers.

-- | Id | CustomerId |
-- +----+------------+
-- | 1  | 3          |
-- | 2  | 1          |
-- +----+------------+
-- Using the above tables as example, return the following:

-- +-----------+
-- | Customers |
